How to:

Use the Map tab -
The Map tab has the following buttons: A zoom in button (displayed as a plus sign) that zooms in when clicked, a zoom out button that zooms out when clicked (displayed as a minus sign), a button that takes the user to their present location when clicked once and displays a compass when clicked again (displayed as an arrow). The user can move around the map by dragging the screen. If wishing to create a report for an ICE sighting, the user must double click on the location on the map that the sighting occurred. This double click will trigger a form that can then be filled out with a detailed report. The user is only permitted to update the description. There is a save and cancel button. If the user wishes to save their report, they can click the save button. If they wish to update a pin that already exists, the user must click on the pin that they wish to update, change the description as desired and click save, again. The pin will be updated for the user and display the new description on the map pin but will be displayed as an additional report on the Reports tab. To view the description of a pin, the user must click the pin.
